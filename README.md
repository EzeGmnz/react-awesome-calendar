```bash
{
    id: (string or numeric) - this is used to uniquely identify an event,
    color: (hex or RBG/RGBA value) - this sets the event color on the calendar,
    from: (utc timestamp) - start date/time of event e.g. '2019-05-05T13:00:00+00:00',
    to: (utc timestamp) - end date/time of event e.g. '2019-05-05T20:00:00+00:00',
    title: (string) - name of event
}
```

### onClickEvent

#### props

```bash
{
    current: {
        year: numeric,
        month: numeric,
        day: numeric
    },
    mode: "dailyMode" || "monthlyMode" || "yearlyMode" - this can be used to determine what the current mode of the calender is. This way you can choose whether to show a year, month or day depending on the mode,
    prev: {
        year: numeric,
        month: numeric,
        day: numeric
    },
    next: {
        year: numeric,
        month: numeric,
        day: numeric
    },
    onClickPrev: function - this will change the calendar to the prev year, month, day depending on the mode
    onClickNext: function - this will change the calendar to the next year, month, day depending on the mode
}
